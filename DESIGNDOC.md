## SOCCER LEAGUE by Peter Thompson

### OVERVIEW
This project is intended to give the results of a soccer leagues match games (whatever that means...i don't play soccer!)
I created a single SoccerLeague class that uses an initialize method to set up all of the necessary instance variables needed.

### CHALLENGES
The biggest challenge in this project was understanding how to break apart the input file and store the necessary data to then later use in displaying the final results.

### IMPROVEMENTS ON EXISTING SOLUTION
Looking through my code for the SoccerLeague class I can see that I had to iterate through the same data multiple times.  I believe this could be refactored to iterate over the input file less.  I also used an array to store data values for teams when a hash would be more performant for look ups.

### TESTING
I was a little confused reading the PROMPT.md file and understanding what the challenge was looking for as far as the structure of my service/application.
