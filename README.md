# README FOR SOCCER LEAGUE

## SERVICE SET UP:
Clone the repository from GitHub
CD into the repository

## RUNNING THE SOCCER LEAGUE SERVICE
In your console run:
`ruby soccer.rb sample-input.txt`

## RUNNING TESTS
Currently the tests do not run.  I did not have time to complete and I also felt like creating a rails app for this single class was over kill but that left me not knowing how to set up unit tests.  I decided to still include a soccer_rspec.rb file that illustrates what some tests should look like for the SoccerLeague model.
